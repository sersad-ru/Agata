# Agata
Agata. The splitted mouse.

Back in the 1980's, the famous russian personal computer ["Agat"](http://agatcomp.ru/agat/index.shtml) has very unusual cursor control system: two independent controllers for the X and Y axes. This was convenient for games if you played with a partner, but was completely useless for other software. However, there were almost no programs that used the graphics mode.

But nowadays independent axis control may be very useful for working with CAD or graphics software. So this simple project brings us back to good old technology.
